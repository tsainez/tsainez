The branch of linguistics that investigates the sounds that make up speech is phonetics. 

The sounds we use, at the most basic level, can be called **phones**. 

# Phonetic Transcription
Since the sixteenth century, linguists have made efforts to use a universal system for writing down sounds. Today, we use the **International Phonetic Alphabet**, which is commonly abbreviated to **IPA**. You can find the alphabet [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English). 

Normally, the transcription is indicated by brackets: the "**b**" sound in "**b**uy" is denoted by [b] The IPA represents speech in **segments**, like the individual [b] phone in the previous example. 

# Making Noise
The **larynx**, located at your Adam's apple, houses the **vocal folds** (sometimes referred to as cords) which you use to manipulate the air your lungs provide into speech sounds, and it's also made out of cartilage.

Air flows from the lungs up into the **trachea** (sometimes called windpipe), and into your larynx. As it goes through the vocal cords, which is also called the **glottis**, different *glottal states* are achieved.

# Glottal States
The two glottal states are: **voiceless** and **voiced**.

When the vocal folds are pulled apart and air passes directly through without a lot of interference, it produces **voiceless** sound. 

Try this: feel your vocal cords as you say the first sound in the word "shy." Now try it with "bird." Notice how the [b] in "bird" causes your vocal cords to vibrate? That's voiced, while the [ʃ] sound in "shy" is voiceless since there is little to no interference caused by (non-present) vocal cord vibrations.

# Classifying Sound
The most basic division of sounds is between the **vowels** and **consonants**, but there are also the **glides** who share properties of both.

Consonants can be either voiced or voiceless but are made with either a complete closure or a narrowing of the vocal tract. Consonants are created by blocking or restricting the airflow. Vowels, which are usually voiced, are made without much obstruction in the vocal tract.

* *Note: for all vowels, the tip of your tongue stays down by your lower front teeth.*

Vowels also happen to be more **sonorous** than consonants, and so we perceive them as louder and longer lasting.

**Syllables** are peaks of sonority— they are surrounded by less sonorous segments. When you count syllables, you are in effect counting vowels, so it can be said that they form the nucleus of a syllable.

| Vowels & syllabic elements | Consonants & nonsyllabic elements|
|-|-|
|are produced with relatively little obstruction in the vocal tract. | are produced with a complete closure or narrowing of the vocal tract. |
|are more sonorous. | are less sonorous. |

Glides can be thought of as rapidly articulated vowels that move quickly to another articulation, like in **y**et and **w**et, or like bo**y** and no**w**. These guys never form the nucleus of a syllable, since they show properties of both consonants and vowels. 

# Places of Articulation
Each part of the body where you can modify the airstream to produce different sounds is called a *place of articulation*.

# Manners of Articulation
Using your lips, tongue, velum, and glottis, you can position them in different *manners of articulation* to produce sounds of different kinds.

When the velum is raised (cutting off airflow through nasal cavity), **oral** sounds are produced.

When the velum is lowered (allowing air to pass through the nasal cavity), **nasal** sounds are produced, like su**n**, su**m** and sun**g**.

When a complete closure in the oral cavity or glottis occurs, it is called a **stop**. It can be found in the bilabial, dental, alveolar, alveopalatal, palatal, velar, uvular and glottal places of articulation.

Here is a table of some of the stop consonants in English.

| | | Bilabial | Alveolar | Velar | Glottal |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Nonnasal| Voiceless| [p] | [t] | [k] | [ʔ] | 
| | Voiced| [b] | [d] | [g] | |
|Nasal| Voiced | [m] | [n] | [ŋ] |

Fricatives are consonants that are produced with continuous airflow through the mouth. They belong to the **continuants**, who also include vowels and glides.

Here's a table of some of the fricatives in English. 

| Glottal state | Point of articulation | Transcription |
|-|-|-|
| | Labiodental | |
| Voiceless | **f**an | [f] |
| Voiced | **v**an | [v] |
| | Interdental | |
| Voiceless | **th**in | [θ] |
| Voiced | **th**en | [ð] |
| | Alveolar | |
| Voiceless | **s**un | [s] |
| Voiced | **z**ip | [z] |
| | Alveopalatal | |
| Voiceless | **sh**ip | [ʃ] |
| Voiced | a**z**ure | [ʒ] |
| | Glottal | |
| Voiceless | **h**at | [h] |

Also worth mentioning: the delay in speech caused by the release of air is called **aspiration**, like the stop right between the [p] in "pat" and the rest of the sounds.

Varieties of [l] are called **liquids** (specifically **laterals**) which are defined by the fact that they are all oral sonorous consonants. 

When an [r] sound is made by curling the tongue tip back and bunching the tongue upwards and back in the mouth, it is called a **retroflex**, and is another example of a liquid.

# Vowels
English vowels are divided into **simple vowels** and **diphthongs**. 

Diphthongs are vowels that change quality within a single syllable, due to tongue movement away from the initial vowel articulation towards a glide position. Some examples of major diphthongs, like "buy" and "boy" and "now."

Vowels are defined by **high** and **low** tongue positions, as well as **front** and **back** positions of the tongue. They can also be said to be in the middle, in which case they are appropriately called mid vowels. We also say vowels are rounded if the lips are protruded.

| h**ea**t | [i] | high front unrounded | 
| f**a**te | [ej] | mid front unrounded |
|m**a**sh | [æ] | low front unrounded |

| S**ue** | [u] | high back rounded |
| b**oa**t | [ow] | mid back rounded |
| c**au**ght | [ɔ] | mid back rounded (sometimes) |

| s**u**n | [ʌ] | mid central unrounded |
|c**o**t | [ɑ] | low back unrounded |

# Suprasegmentals
Phones have **suprasegmental** or **prosodic properties**, like **pitch**, **loudness**, and **length**.

Pitch allows us to place it on a scale from high to low, and is especially noticeable in sonorous sounds like vowels, glides, liquids, and nasals.

The control of pitch results in **tone** and **intonation**. 

A language is said to have tone when **differences in word meaning are signaled by differences in pitch**.

When one says "A *car?*" with a raising pitch, the word "car" refers to the same thing as when it's pronounced without that raised pitch; this is **intonation**. In contrast, a speaker of Mandarin can say entirely different words by changing the pitch; this is **tone**. For instance: [mà] with a falling pitch means something entirely different than [má] with a rising pitch. 

The amount and classification of tone varies from language to language.

> But, intonation signals meaning too, right?

Yes! It does, but it does not change the meaning of a word, rather just signals something *different*.

For instance, if I raise my pitch when saying a phrase, it signals that the phrase might be incomplete— teachers and professors do this all the time when they want students to finish their sentences.

Also, it's worth noting that some languages make use of both intonation and tone *at the same time*.

Sometimes, vowels are perceived as more prominent than others, like how in "banana" the second syllable is more prominent than the other two. **Stress** covers the combined effects of pitch, loudness and length, which gives us this perceived prominence.

# Summary
- Sounds in language are described in articulatory and acoustic terms, and fall into the syllabic sounds or nonsyllabic sounds. 
- Sounds may be voiced or voiceless, and oral or nasal. 
- Consonants and glides are produced at various places of articulation, and different manners of articulation produce different sounds, from fricatvies to glides. 
- Vowels can be described with reference to tongue position and lip rounding.
- Language also has suprasegmental phenomena like tone, intonation and stress.
