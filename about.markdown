The purpose of this personal website is twofold: to serve as a resume, and to serve as a repository of information primarily for myself. Sometimes, I will upload little posts containing some information on coding, technology, linguistics or anything else of interest. Usually, the criteria for warranting a post on here is that the information is long enough to not be stored on an actual sticky note, or is particularly important, significant or interesting enough to preserve for later.

As of writing this, I'm currently a student at the University of California, coming into my second year. I working with Dr. Shijia Pan on her lab group's footstep localization project, where I work on the particular problem of low-cost device synchronization. I'm also taking a bunch of math courses over the summer: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, Probability and Statistics, and Vector Calculus. So, it's safe to say I'm a little busy for now.

To be perfectly honest, I am not convinced that employers ever go through the effort to look through any of their dozens of applicant's websites and GitHub projects. So, that being said...

*Why* make the website? 

Well, to be honest, I'm not sure! I think it was an interesting way to pass some of my free time as a freshman when there was really nothing else to do. It wasn't hard, it was just difficult to find a motivation.

Anyway, here's some photos from around campus.
